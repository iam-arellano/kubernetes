emptyDir - you can backup your data using emptyDir but when pod restart or delete, your backup data will be loss and you cannot share data to other pod or worker node

hostPath - you can backup your data using hostPath and you can share your backup data to other pod. but when the node restart or delete your backup data will be loss and you cannot share data to other node

PersistentVolume -  you can backup your data using persistentVolume the advantage using this is persistentVolume is not dependable on any pod or node .

persistent volume accessmode type:

- ReadWriteMany- the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes (accessible in all node)

- ReadWriteOnce -  the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
- ReadOnlyOnce - the volume can be mounted as read by single node (single node)
- ReadOnlyMany  for single node

- ReadWriteOncepad - the volume can be mounted as read-write in one pods (one pod only)


PersistentVolumeClaim - this volume connected to pvs because you cannot create pvs directly to the pod or node . PersistentVolumeClaim is a request for a specific amount and access mode of storage from a PersistentVolume. PVCs are used by pods to request storage resources and bind them to the appropriate PV
