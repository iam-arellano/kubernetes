Prometheus and Grafana are monitoring tools used in Kubernetes to help keep track of the health and performance of your applications running on the Kubernetes cluster.

Prometheus is a time-series database that collects and stores metrics data from your applications and infrastructure. It can help you monitor things like CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.

Grafana is a visualization tool that helps you create dashboards and graphs to visualize the data collected by Prometheus. It allows you to easily see trends and patterns in your metrics data.


Sample Scenario: Let's say you have a web application running on a Kubernetes cluster. You can set up Prometheus to collect metrics data from the application, such as response time and error rate. You can then use Grafana to create a dashboard that shows the performance of the application over time. This can help you quickly identify any issues and make improvements to ensure the application runs smoothly.
