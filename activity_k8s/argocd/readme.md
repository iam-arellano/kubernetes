ArgoCD is a tool that helps deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes in a reliable and automated way, making it easier for teams to collaborate and ensure consistent deployments. It helps streamline the deployment process and reduce errors.


Sample scenario:
Imagine you have a web application running on a Kubernetes cluster. With ArgoCD, you can define the desired state of your application in a Git repository. When changes are made to the application code, ArgoCD automatically detects the changes and deploys the updated application to the cluster. If there are any issues during deployment, ArgoCD can easily roll back to a previous stable version.
