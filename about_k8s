What is k8s?

- k8s is an orchestation tool allowing you to run and manage your container-base workloads


What is pod

- pod is a smallest unit of deployment of k8s you can run 1 or more container 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Worker Node

Kubeproxy - is responsible for networking and provide network like ip address and also the load balancing. kubeproxy is reponsible to comunicate pod to pod and to make application accessible to end user

Kubelet - is responsible for running your application and if pod or application is not running  kubelet inform one of the components  and control plane detect something wrong  

Container runtime - runs container inside pod

deployment >> services


Clusterip -  is the default service type in Kubernetes, and it provides internal connectivity between different components of our application.

loadbalancer type is using for internal and external ip


nordport -  is a service that is used to expose the application to the internet from where the end-users can access it. If you create a NodePort Service Kubernetes will assign the port within the range of (30000-32767). The application can be accessed by end-users using the node's IP address

What is Namespace?

- Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters â€” they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster.

Example
   for using namespaces in Kubernetes could be a company with multiple development teams working on different projects. Each team can have their own namespace to deploy and manage their applications, ensuring that their resources are isolated from other teams. This helps in organizing and managing the resources efficiently within the Kubernetes cluster.
